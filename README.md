# Contact-book
Contact Book Project - README
This is a Contact Book project developed using React and Node.js. The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface to manage contacts, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete contact information.

Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

Frontend
The frontend of the project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The source code for the frontend is located in the frontend directory.

Inside the frontend directory, you will find the following files and directories:

src: Contains the source code for the React components, styles, and other related files.
components: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
pages: Contains the main pages of the application, such as the contact list and contact details pages.
App.js: The main component that serves as the entry point for the application.
index.js: Renders the App component and mounts it to the DOM.
public: Contains the static assets and the index.html file used as the template for the application.
Backend
The backend of the project is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime. It provides a RESTful API to handle contact operations and interacts with a database to store and retrieve contact information. The source code for the backend is located in the backend directory.

Inside the backend directory, you will find the following files and directories:

src: Contains the source code for the backend server and routes.
controllers: Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.
models: Contains the database models for the contacts.
routes: Defines the API routes for handling different CRUD operations.
app.js: Sets up the Express server and middleware.
config.js: Contains configuration settings, such as the database connection details.
index.js: The entry point of the backend application.
